What it is
==========

Having to enter your username and password to use Kotnet or Campusnet tends to be a pain in the *ss on a smart-phone. The Android Kotnet Login app is a small Android app to log you in to Kotnet with a single finger tap. For now, only KU Leuven students and personnel can use the app, other organization are not supported. Also, the app can't log you in automatically, you still have to press the button :)

How it works
============

The app stores your Kotnet username and password on the phone. To log in, it fetches the login page (the same you use to log in), enters your credentials and submits the form. That's it. Nothing is shared with anyone.

Download
========

The app is not available in the Android Market (yet). You can manually download the latest version of the app in the downloads section.

How to install
==============

To install the .apk file, follow the guidelines described here: http://www.brighthub.com/mobile/google-android/articles/37151.aspx
